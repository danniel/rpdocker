RapidPro Docker
=============

This project contains the scripts needed for running RapidPro and its required services inside Docker.
It also adds the Temba Importer plugin besides the default RapidPro installation.


Before running any ``make`` commands, be sure to update your custom ``.env`` file. Use the ``.env.example`` file as an example.
